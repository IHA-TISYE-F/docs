The goal of the system is to protect the aircraft from enemy incoming missiles by deploying flares and chaffs. It also provides threat information to the information computer, which interacts with the pilot. 
It is possible for a technician to load the system with chaffs and flares. During the preparation phase before the missions, the system informs the technicians about the current amount of chaffs and flares present on the aircraft.
