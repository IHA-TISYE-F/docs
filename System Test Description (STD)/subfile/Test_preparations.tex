Requirement: \textit{Manual mode shall dispense the program selected by the pilot. The pilot may select payload, and dispense direction as defined by UR-2.}
\\
Manual mode is selected. The operator will then dispense the desired payload in the desired direction. All combinations of payload and direction is tested.

The system main power source must be turned on.

\paragraph{ReqNo8-T}\mbox{}\\ % Lars N
Requirement: \textit{The system shall be able to dispense a minimum of two payloads within 0.1 sec.}
\\
Using manual mode, the operator tries to dispense two payloads simultaneously. It is measured whether the payloads are dispensed within 0.1 sec.
\\
	\subparagraph{Preparations needed:}
	\begin{itemize}

Requirement: \textit{The system shall provide the aircraft mission computer
with status information and built-in test results.}
\\
Test-software installed on the mission computer requests status information and built-in test results from the system. The test-software verifies that the received data is correct.
\\
	\subparagraph{Preparations needed:}
	\begin{itemize}
